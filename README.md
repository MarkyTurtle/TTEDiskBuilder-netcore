# TTEDiskBuilder-netcore
Utility for the creation of .ADF disk images based on the code created by h0ffman at the following repo

 - [https://github.com/djh0ffman/TTEDiskBuilder](https://github.com/djh0ffman/TTEDiskBuilder)

I needed a version that I could run under VSCode, so that meant converting it to use .NET Core.

I've removed the data compression functionality for the time being and made the utility functional for my needs.
